# Skyrim (secondlaw-ai/skyrim) — quick note

Skyrim is an open-source interface / model zoo to **run large weather models (LWMs)** such as GraphCast, Pangu, and FourCastNet with minimal setup on **consumer-grade GPUs**. It streamlines fetching initial conditions (e.g., GFS/IFS), running forecasts, and producing outputs/visualizations. 

**Why useful for civil/environmental engineering?** For tasks like **wind resource assessment, extreme weather risk, coastal operations planning**, and **storm response**, you can spin up ensembles, generate short‑ to medium‑range forecasts, and rapidly visualize hazards affecting field work or infrastructure designs.
